## About molkky

> The players (or teams) each play in turn, trying to knock down numbered pins by throwing the Mölkky from the launching zone. All throwing styles are allowed. A pin is only considered knocked down if it has fallen entirely to the ground. If a pin is in equilibrium on another pin, the Mölkky or a natural piece of land (tree stump, tree trunk …) it is not considered as knocked down. If the pin rests against an artificial element (cement border, a bench, …) it is considered as knocked down.

> A player can score points in only one of two ways:
>
> - Knocking over exactly one pin scores the amount of points that is marked on the respective pin
> - Knocking over two or more pins scores the number of pins that were knocked over (e.g. knocking over 3 pins scores 3 points)

> The winning player is the first to reach exactly 50 points, thereby ending the game. If a player's score exceeds 50, it is set back to 25. A player that misses all of the target pins three times in a row is eliminated from the game. In case all players are eliminated before anyone reaches 50 points, the last remaining player wins.
